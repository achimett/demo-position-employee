# demo-position-employee
This is a throwaway-project that I created to teach myself some Spring technologies: Core, Boot, Data JPA, Data REST.

It's a service that exposes employees information and their professional position.

The Bash script `demo.bash` has some HTTP calls that can be made to the service.
