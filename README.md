# demo-position-employee
This is a throwaway-project that I created to teach myself some Spring technologies: Core, Boot, Data JPA, Data REST.

It's a service that exposes employees information and their professional position.

The test class `DemoPositionEmployeeApplicationTest` and the Bash script `demo.bash` have some example HTTP calls that can be made to the service.

Also, `DemoPositionEmployeeApplicationTest` shows a correct use of [level 3 REST API](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) thanks to [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS).
